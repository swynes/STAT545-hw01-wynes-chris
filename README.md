They say a picture is worth 1000 words - but have you ever considered how many lines of code that might convert to? Regardless of the answer, Markdown makes it easy include pictures of all sorts into your document. Don't believe me? See the source code yourself!

### Link logic

Let's say that the comic sourced in the previous section had a home page where it could be viewed - we can [link to that page using Markdown](https://xkcd.com/418/) with relative ease. If you look at the source code, it's really quite simple, so there's not much more to say about this here!

### HTML has you covered for everything else
