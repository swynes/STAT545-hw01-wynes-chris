## Reflections on this homework
I don't have a lot of experience coding, but I still found it pretty easy to add links, an image, make lists and change text by bolding them or making them into headers. However, making all of these changes in R and getting used to the workflow of pushing and committing was more difficult. There are a lot of intricacies with organizing your files and sometimes it was difficult for me to discern what information I absolutely needed to understand before I could competently complete a task. For instance, how importance is it for me to know the difference between a .rmd file and a .md file etc.?

I was impressed with Rmarkdown and generally with the idea that you can code in the same document that will create your final product (pdf, webpage etc.). That being said, I question the feasibility of using this approach on many projects (for instance, projects where some collaborators are not familiar with R and would be more comfortable with tracking changes on a word document). I also needed some help when a small change in my yaml header prevented me from knitting altogether (I accidentally deleted a grave accent and replaced it with an apostrophe). I think this underscored the lesson for me that it is important to copy and paste code and not type it out when you're following someone else's procedure, as I never would have spotted the difference intitially.
