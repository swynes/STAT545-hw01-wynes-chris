## Overview
**For my homework, I have created a readme document to introduce myself to the class and experiment with the range of Markdown features.**

#### Seth Wynes

*I am a PhD student in the Department of Geography*


Want to *italicize* something? Maybe even **bold** or ~~strikeout~~ a phrase? How about **combining <del>*a few of</del> them at a* time?** For that, Markdown has you covered.

#### Bullet point basics

- How about lists?
- They work nicely too
	+ Sometimes
		* we can
			- even
				+ indent them

#### Header how-tos

The header above is "H4" size. This readme document's headers' sizes range from "H2" to "H4" depending on the number of hashtags in front of them

### Quoting quotables

### Imagining images

They say a picture is worth 1000 words - but have you ever considered how many lines of code that might convert to? Regardless of the answer, Markdown makes it easy include pictures of all sorts into your document. Don't believe me? See the source code yourself!

### Link logic

Let's say that the comic sourced in the previous section had a home page where it could be viewed - we can [link to that page using Markdown](https://xkcd.com/418/) with relative ease. If you look at the source code, it's really quite simple, so there's not much more to say about this here!

### HTML has you covered for everything else
